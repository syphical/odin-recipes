    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sheet Pan Pancakes are a quick and easy way to make pancakes for a crowd.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups (354g) all-purpose flour (scoop and level to measure), plus 1 Tbsp for dusting pan/li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Brush an 18 by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp melted butter, then dust baking sheet with 1 Tbsp flour and shake to coat. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 20 seconds. Make a well in center of mixture.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs in a separate large mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs together then add in buttermilk and vanilla extract and mix.</li>
        <li>While whisking pour in 5 Tbsp melted butter and mix well (it will clump up a little that's fine).</li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture and whisk until combined, batter should be slightly lumpy (don't over-mix or pancakes won't be as fluffy).</li>
        <li>Right away pour batter into prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until baked through (a toothpick should come out clean), about 15 to 18 minutes (note that each oven browns differently if your oven didn't get a golden brown top you can remove then adjust oven rack closer to broiler, preheat broiler and let it toast just very briefly keeping a close eye on it).</li>
        <li>Brush remaining 1 Tbsp melted butter over top, cut into squares and serve warm with maple syrup or other desired topping of choice.</li>
    </ol>
